		Firstly you need to know how much energy your battery can store and then select a Solar panel that can replenish
		your ‘stock’ of energy in the battery in line with your pattern of use.

	<span> A common question that people ask regarding the battery’s are:</span>
	<h3 id="q1"> 1 : What are examples of electronic devices? </h3>
	<p>
		Here is a list of Electronic devices include televisions, DVD players, laptops, desktop computers, mobile
		phones, iPods, iPads, cameras, fans, ovens, washing machines, game consoles, printers and radios. That should
		give you a simple reference point in under standing the term Electronic devices.
	</p>
	<h3 id="q2"> 2 : What is the Power in Use</h3>
	<p>
		They range from a few watts , to a few kilowatts (kiloWatt-hours) . The value will be indicated when you buy the
		appliances themselves. <br> Bulbs - 0 to 100 (Watts various types)<br> Heaters - water heaters mostly have
		around some 100kWh s depending upon the model and capacity (note that they need 5A current lines/plug
		points)<br> Mixie - 600 to more Watts and so on.<br> 1 Watt= 1 Joule/s<br> A person having a mass of 100
		kilograms who climbs a 3-meter-high ladder in 5 seconds is doing work at a rate of about 600 watts <br> A
		laborer over the course of an 8-hour day can sustain an average output of about 75 watts; higher power levels
		can be achieved for short intervals and by athletes.<br>
	</p>

	<h3 id="q3">
		3 : How much energy can your battery store?
	</h3>
	<p>
		Battery capacity is measured in Amp Hours (e.g. 17AH). You need to convert this to Watt Hours by multiplying the
		AH figure by the battery voltage (e.g. 12V). this is just the simple calculation below<br>X (Battery size in AH)
		x Y (Battery Voltage) = Z (Power available in watt hours For a 20AH, 12V battery the Watt Hours figure is 20(X)
		x 12(Y) = 240 WH (Z)<br>
		This means the battery could supply 240W for 1 hour, 120W for 2 hours or even 2w for 120 hours i.e. the more
		energy you take, the faster the battery discharges.
	</p>
	<p>
		However you are never really able to take all the power from a battery as once the voltage drops below your
		equipment’s requirements it will no longer be able to power it. There is a simple rule of thumb for this but
		please check your battery’s specifications to make sure. Lead acid battery’s will give you around 50% of their
		rated power. (i.e. a 10Ah battery has 5Ah of usable power) Li-ion battery’s will give you around 80% of their
		rated power. (i.e. a 10Ah battery has 8Ah of usable power)

	</center>
	<h3 id="q4"> 4: Are car battery’s just as good for solar as leisure battery’s? </h3>
	<p>A. The answer to this is no they are not. The reason is because a leisure battery has been designed to be
		discharged and recharge, a Car battery is designed to provide a lot of power quickly but it’s not able to cope
		with a low internal charge and recover fully. </p>
	<h3 id="q5">
		5 : How much energy will your appliance(s) use over a period of time?
	</h3>
	<P> The power consumption of appliances is generally given in Watts (e.g. A small portable TV is around 20W this
		information can be found on the data sticker that most electrical items have). To calculate the energy you will
		use over time, just multiply the power consumption by the hours of intended use. The 20W TV in this example, on
		for 2 hours, will take 20 x 2 = 40WH from the battery.<br> Repeat this for all the appliances you wish to use,
		then add the results to establish total consumption like below.</P>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td>TV 20w on for 2 hours per day</td>
			<td> = 40w per day</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> Radio 10w on for 5 hours per day</td>
			<td> = 50w per day</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> Water pump (20w) on for 20mins per day</td>
			<td> = 6.66w per days</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> Main Light 30w on for 3h per day</td>
			<td> = 90w per days</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> Spot lights 10w on for 1h per day </td>
			<td> = 10w per days</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> Total</td>
			<td> = 196w per day</td>
		</tr>

	<p>An easy way to lower your power usage is to swap out halogen lights for LED lights. LED lights generally use 80%
		less energy for a similar light level. </p>

	<h3 id="q6"> 6 : How much energy can a Solar panel generate over a period of time?</h3>
	<p> The final part to sizing your solar system is the solar panels. The power generation rating of a Solar panel is
		also given in Watts (e.g. our part number STP010, is a 10W solar panel). In Theory, to calculate the energy it
		can supply to the battery, you multiply Watts (of the solar panel) by the hours exposed to sunshine.<br> In
		practice it’s not a great way to calculate the output from a solar panel so we work to a few simple rules.</p>
	<ul>
		<li> We would generally advise that an average UK winters day will only give you 1 hours sunshine </li>
		<li> An average UK summers days will give you 6 hours of sunshine. </li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		So in winter a 10w panel will provide 10w worth of energy back into your battery. (10w x 1 = 10w)<br>In Summer a
		10w panel will provide 60w worth of energy back into your battery. (10w x 6 = 60w)<br>Using the above
		calculation takes into consideration any losses in the system from the regulator, cables and battery you may be
		using.
	</p>



	<h3 id="q7"> 7 : Putting it all together to size your system. </h3>

	<p>Knowing your power requirements and the time of year you want to use the system is vital. The final Piece to
		complete your solar system is the Charge Controller or Voltage Regulator. Its basically the same thing just a
		different name. This essential piece of your solar system controls the Charge put into your battery, stops
		overcharging and prevents the solar panel pulling power from the battery at night.</p>
	<h3 id="q8">
		8: On an appliance, what does the wattage value indicate?
	</h3>
	<p>
		1000 watts is an instantaneous value, called power. Power used over an hour would be energy. 10000 W used for an
		hour is 1000 Watt-hours or 1 KWh.<br> When a device is labeled 1000W that is usually the maximum value.<br> For
		motorized appliances with multiple speeds, that would be the most power-consuming speed.<br> For a bulb, it
		would always use 1000W, but for a refrigerator, heater or something with a thermostat, it can switch on and off
		and will have a duty cycle of less than 100%, so the average power will be less.<br> The average power times the
		duty cycle times the time gives the true energy.<br> If a 500 W rated refrigerator compressor operated 40% of
		the time to keep its internal temperature at the recommended 38°F then over a 24 hour period of time it would
		use 0.40 x 500 x 24 Watt hours. That’s 4800 W-hours or 4.8 KWh.
